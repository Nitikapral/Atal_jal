                                    sustainable groundwater management which can be taken to scale. The major objective
                                    of the
                                    Scheme is to improve the management of groundwater resources in select
                                    water-stressed areas
                                    in identified states viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra,
                                    Rajasthan,
                                    and Uttar Pradesh. <br><br>

                                    Atal Jal is targeted at sustainable groundwater management, mainly through
                                    convergence
                                    among various ongoing schemes with the active involvement of local communities and
                                    stakeholders. This will ensure that in the Scheme area, the funds allocated by the
                                    Central
                                    and State governments are spent judiciously to ensure the long-term sustainability
                                    of
                                    groundwater resources. The convergence shall further result in incentives to State
                                    Governments for suitable investments, aided by a strong database, scientific
                                    approach, and
                                    community participation. The scheme has been designed as a pilot with the principal
                                    objective of strengthening the institutional framework for participatory groundwater
                                    management. It also aims at bringing about behavioral change at the community level
                                    through
                                    awareness programs and capacity building for fostering sustainable groundwater

                                    community through convergence of various ongoing /new central anschemes.

                                    depend upon ground water assets for
                                    flourishing and wellbeing. The arrest in decline of ground water levels is
                                    likely to
                                    improve water regimes required for
